# ✨Word_Guess_Game✨

this project:
1. First, we start with the start button and the textFields will not be activated until we press this button.
2. When we press the start button, the fields are activated. In the first field, the word that we have to guess is displayed, several letters of which have been deleted.
3. In the second field, if you guess the word correctly, the correct message will be displayed, otherwise, the wrong message will be displayed.
4. The next button will show the next word.
